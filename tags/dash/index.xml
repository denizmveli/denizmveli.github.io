      <description>Yep it&amp;rsquo;s here! This long awaited release of Dash for App.net brings support for private messages.
You can now chat privately with all your App.net followers, anytime, anywhere.
Better yet existing Dash Plus features such as push notifications for mentions and background updates of streams are now totally free for all. That&amp;rsquo;s pretty big news for all you Android App.net fans out there. I&amp;rsquo;ll be expanding push notifications in the coming weeks to support private messages and more.</description>

      <description>Over the last few weeks, while working on bringing the latest and greatest features to Hooha, I&amp;rsquo;ve kept a constant focus on user feedback.
The biggest piece of feedback received was &amp;ldquo;Love the app, hate the name&amp;rdquo;.
I felt this update released today, which brings the app out of beta, was an appropriate time to spend some effort on the brand. Working together with my good friend Toby Simm (Simmple)Â on branding and graphic design, I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to bring the new and improved Dash for App.</description>

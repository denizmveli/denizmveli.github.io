      <title>Etsy Local Goes Mobile</title>

&lt;p&gt;Last week my anxiety and anticipation was building, as a whole lot of work from a great team of individuals I lead at Etsy was just about to be released to the world. And that feeling is exactly what I get out of bed and go to work for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then we launched the all new Etsy Local home screen tab on the Etsy app the iOS and Android!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Etsy Local you can find Etsy items and sellers near you, at events like pop-ups, craft fairs, and flea markets or local shops. Etsy sellers can add events like craft fairs and markets that they are selling at, and retailers that are part of Etsy Wholesale can have their brick-and-mortar stores included on Etsy Local as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on Etsy Local for most of this year, it&amp;rsquo;s with great excitement that I share the release of our new browsable Local experience in the Etsy app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s a great way to discover new sellers  and a great new channel for sellers to be found on Etsy, all while supporting the growth of local small businesses through commerce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read more about the launch from my colleague Johanna Beyenbach, over on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://etsy.me/1fT1oAe&#34;&gt;Etsy blog&lt;/a&gt;. You can find local stores and events happening in your neighborhood in the latest version of the Etsy shopping app, available on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.etsy.android&#34;&gt;Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/etsy/id477128284?mt=8&#34;&gt;Apple App Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m super excited and very honored that Google recently placed our latest Etsy Android app on a very short list of the best Android apps released this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read more over on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://android-developers.blogspot.com.au/2013/12/beautiful-design-collection-winter-2013.html&#34;&gt;Android Developers blog&lt;/a&gt; and if you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet been shopping on the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.etsy.android&#34;&gt;Etsy for Android&lt;/a&gt; app on your tablet or phone, this might be just the reminder you need.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Etsy Android Staggered Grid</title>
      <link>http://replace-this-with-your-hugo-site.com/_posts/etsy-android-staggered-grid/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week at Etsy we open sourced the staggered grid view from the new Etsy Android app. Somewhat surprisingly there&amp;rsquo;s been a large amount of interest from the Android community. I guess I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised. Whilst working on various apps I&amp;rsquo;ve found it challenging to implement advanced UI elements such as the staggered or masonry grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github-camo.global.ssl.fastly.net/a243ad5c2788730c40fc1d348e5ed85adb59c484/687474703a2f2f662e636c2e6c792f6974656d732f327a31423059304d3047304f326b316c334a30332f5472656e64696e672e706e67&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully I had the opportunity during a recent project at Etsy to implement this grid view that would support advanced features such as rows of varying heights &amp;amp; syncing row positions across orientation changes. Before deciding to develop the grid, we did of course evaluate existing options available including the unfinished StaggeredGridView in the AOSP source. In the end we came to the conclusion that if we were going to build something stable, reliable and performant it was a necessity to understand the entire scope of how the grid functioned and to achieve that we decided to develop a new component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m quite happy with the results. The grid was developed over the course of two weeks. During the project we tested the grid on a number of devices available in our awesome &lt;a href=&#34;http://codeascraft.com/2013/08/09/mobile-device-lab/&#34;&gt;Etsy Device Lab&lt;/a&gt;. We also found and fixed a couple of issues with the grid post launch using live crash logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally after open sourcing the grid, we&amp;rsquo;ve promoted release artifacts for the initial version to Maven Central, and will maintain releases here ongoing. So now it&amp;rsquo;s a simple one-liner to add the AndroidStaggeredGrid to your project. Big thanks here go to Chris Banes for his helpful &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/chrisbanes/gradle-mvn-push&#34;&gt;Gradle plugin&lt;/a&gt; for uploading Android Artifacts to Maven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find out more, how the grid is used and also run the sample app over on the Etsy Github - &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/etsy/AndroidStaggeredGrid&#34;&gt;https://github.com/etsy/AndroidStaggeredGrid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

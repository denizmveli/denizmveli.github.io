      <description>Last week at Etsy we open sourced the staggered grid view from the new Etsy Android app. Somewhat surprisingly there&amp;rsquo;s been a large amount of interest from the Android community. I guess I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised. Whilst working on various apps I&amp;rsquo;ve found it challenging to implement advanced UI elements such as the staggered or masonry grid.
Thankfully I had the opportunity during a recent project at Etsy to implement this grid view that would support advanced features such as rows of varying heights &amp;amp; syncing row positions across orientation changes.</description>
